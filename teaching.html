    <h1>Experimental System Development March 1, 2024</h1>
    <h2>Writing problem statements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/problem-statements/">NN problem statement writing (more of industry-facing doc.)</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">Toyota's Five Whys</a> Getting at the root cause.
                Solving the first why won't help you with what is really happening, get to the root cause by asking why 5 times (this is part of problem definition, and will likely occur with different questions throughout the problem discovery workshops).
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Scenarios</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Make a comic - try <a href ="https://www.tldraw.com/">Tldraw</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Pretend you are explaining the situation to someone who has no idea what is going on, be specific, paint a picture, imagine you are explaining your scneario as a movie.
        </li>
        <li>
            Act it out! Take on the roles of the people and act out the scenario.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Externalization</h2>
    <p> to get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_operational_picture">common operating picture</a>, drawing and writing can be helpful. If you need inspiration look at Karen Holtzblatt's, but trust your gut, and give it your first go, and iterate. </p>

    <h2>Making education work for you</h2>
    <p>Think about what you aim to get out of your time in university. 
        What can you do to adapt how you spend your time to the goals you want to achieve? 
        A personal example, I wanted to enjoy university. 
        So I found the tasks that I enjoyed, it turned out to be research, and tried to do more of it.
        I spent more time developing research-based skills.
        Maybe for you, you can use the project time to grow confidence as a kicka** programmer. 
        Or maybe you want to get better at communication skills, then the hand ins are your time to think about how you are communicating with your audience (me), and how you might better expresss yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>User stories</h2>
    <li> 
        <ul>“As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”</ul>

       <ul>
        Think about who are you writing this user story for and why, some will be more specific than others
        based on if you are delivering to developers or if you are doing it as a part of a design process.
        Atlassian has one way of doing things:<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories">Atlassian User stories</a>
       </ul>
    </li>

      Data processing steps w/ whipser AI - modify for your use, this is from a research project <br>
      0. Check that participant has completed consent form if sent prior to the meeting    <br>
      1. Create a Zoom meeting    <br>
      2. Go through intro of interview script (send consent form if needed)    <br>
      3. Start recording – run interview & say thanks    <br>
      4. Save recording    <br>
      5. Add participant to key    <br>
      6. Rename recording to P[]    <br>
      7. Run:     <br>
      sudo whisper ./Documents/Advising/Recordings/P4/audio1580761153.m4a --model large    <br>
      8. Enter password    <br>
      9. Copy and paste into a text file (could do this automatically)    <br>
